# How to edit the wiki

All you need is to put your Markdown files in the `wiki/` folder and commit them to the default branch to trigger the workflow.


Each page has an auto-generated title. 
It is derived from the filename by replacing every - (dash) character with a space.
Name your files accordingly. 
The Home.md file will automatically become the homepage, not README.md. 
This is specific to GitHub wikis.
